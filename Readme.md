# 2D cellular automaton with 3-cell states

## Complite implementation of 2D cellular automaton project written in C++.

This project was written as one of the tasks during the Physics Numerical Methods class. This project implements a cellular automaton with 3 possible states of the cells. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:
* Create a class for cells 
* Time evolution of population according to the rules of cell interaction 
* Create an SFML window
* Interface for finding the most interesting pattern 

## Example of the rule 396985
